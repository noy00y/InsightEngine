A NOTE ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:
 From time to time, we make written or oral forward-looking statements within the meaning of certain securities laws, including in this Investor
Presentation, in other filings with Canadian securities regulators or the SEC and in other communications. All such statements are made pursuant to the "safe harbour" provisions of, and are intended to be
forward-looking statements under applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation, including the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to,
statements made in the "Message from the President and Chief Executive Officer", "Overview - Performance against objectives", "Economic and market environment - Outlook for calendar year 2024",
"Significant events", "Financial performance overview - Taxes", "Strategic business units overview - Canadian Personal and Business Banking", "Strategic business units overview - Canadian Commercial
Banking and Wealth Management", "Strategic business units overview - U.S. Commercial Banking and Wealth Management", "Strategic business units overview - Capital Markets and Direct Financial
Services", "Financial condition - Capital management", "Financial condition - Off-balance sheet arrangements", "Management of risk - Risk overview", "Management of risk - Top and emerging risks",
"Management of risk - Credit risk", "Management of risk - Market risk", "Management of risk - Liquidity risk", "Accounting and control matters - Critical accounting policies and estimates", "Accounting and
control matters - Accounting developments", "Accounting and control matters - Other regulatory developments" and "Accounting and control matters - Controls and procedures" sections of the 2023
Annual Report and other statements about our operations, business lines, financial condition, risk management, priorities, targets and sustainability commitments (including with respect to net-zero
emissions and our environmental, social and governance (ESG) related activities), ongoing objectives, strategies, the regulatory environment in which we operate and outlook for calendar year 2024 and
subsequent periods. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by the words "believe", "expect", "anticipate", "intend", "estimate", "forecast", "target", "predict", "commit", "ambition", "goal", "strive",
"project", "objective" and other similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as "will", "may", "should", "would" and "could". By their nature, these statements require us to make assumptions,
including the economic assumptions set out in the "Economic and market environment - Outlook for calendar year 2024" section of the 2023 Annual Report, and are subject to inherent risks and
uncertainties that may be general or specific. Given the continuing impact of high inflation, rising interest rates, ongoing adverse developments in the U.S. banking sector which adds pressure on liquidity
and funding conditions for the financial industry, the impact of hybrid work arrangements and higher interest rates on the U.S. real estate sector, potential recession and the war in Ukraine and conflict in
the Middle East on the global economy, financial markets, and our business, results of operations, reputation and financial condition, there is inherently more uncertainty associated with our assumptions
as compared to prior periods. A variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control, affect our operations, performance and results, and could cause actual results to differ materially from the
expectations expressed in any of our forward-looking statements. These factors include: inflationary pressures; global supply-chain disruptions; geopolitical risk, including from the war in Ukraine and
conflict in the Middle East, the occurrence, continuance or intensification of public health emergencies, such as the impact of post-pandemic hybrid work arrangements, and any related government policies
and actions; credit, market, liquidity, strategic, insurance, operational, reputation, conduct and legal, regulatory and environmental risk; currency value and interest rate fluctuations, including as a result of
market and oil price volatility; the effectiveness and adequacy of our risk management and valuation models and processes; legislative or regulatory developments in the jurisdictions where we operate,
including the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Common Reporting Standard, and regulatory reforms in the United Kingdom and Europe, the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision's global standards for capital and liquidity reform, and those relating to bank recapitalization legislation and the payments system in Canada; amendments to, and interpretations of, risk-based
capital guidelines and reporting instructions, and interest rate and liquidity regulatory guidance; exposure to, and the resolution of, significant litigation or regulatory matters, our ability to successfully appeal
adverse outcomes of such matters and the timing, determination and recovery of amounts related to such matters; the effect of changes to accounting standards, rules and interpretations; changes in our
estimates of reserves and allowances; changes in tax laws; changes to our credit ratings; political conditions and developments, including changes relating to economic or trade matters; the possible effect
on our business of international conflicts, such as the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East, and terrorism; natural disasters, disruptions to public infrastructure and other catastrophic events;
reliance on third parties to provide components of our business infrastructure; potential disruptions to our information technology systems and services; increasing cyber security risks which may include
theft or disclosure of assets, unauthorized access to sensitive information, or operational disruption; social media risk; losses incurred as a result of internal or external fraud; anti-money laundering; the
accuracy and completeness of information provided to us concerning clients and counterparties; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to us and our affiliates or associates; intensifying
competition from established competitors and new entrants in the financial services industry including through internet and mobile banking; technological change including the use of data and artificial
intelligence in our business; global capital market activity; changes in monetary and economic policy; general business and economic conditions worldwide, as well as in Canada, the U.S. and other
countries where we have operations, including increasing Canadian household debt levels and global credit risks; climate change and other ESG related risks; our success in developing and introducing
new products and services, expanding existing distribution channels, developing new distribution channels and realizing increased revenue from these channels; changes in client spending and saving
habits; our ability to attract and retain key employees and executives; our ability to successfully execute our strategies and complete and integrate acquisitions and joint ventures; the risk that expected
benefits of an acquisition, merger or divestiture will not be realized within the expected time frame or at all; and our ability to anticipate and manage the risks associated with these factors. This list is not
exhaustive of the factors that may affect any of our forward looking statements. These and other factors should be considered carefully and readers should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking
statements. Any forward-looking statements contained in this Investor Presentation represent the views of management only as of the date hereof and are presented for the purpose of assisting our
shareholders and financial analysts in understanding our financial position, objectives and priorities and anticipated financial performance as at and for the periods ended on the dates presented, and may
not be appropriate for other purposes. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that is contained in this Investor Presentation or in other communications except as required by law.

NoneNet Write-offs:

*
Overall consumer net write-offs increased slightly QoQ from Unsecured 
Personal Lending due to sustained high interest rates and rising 
unemployment rates
*
YoY increases in credit cards and personal lending were driven by 
clients' behavior normalization and increasing unemployment rates
*
Cards remained favourable to pre-pandemic levels due to favourable 
insolvencies performance and the acquired Costco portfolio credit quality

None90+ Days Delinquencies:

*
Consumer 90+ delinquency ratio was up QoQ (4bps) and YoY (7bps)
*
Mortgage delinquencies were slowly increasing due to vintage seasoning 
but remain lower than pre-pandemic levels
*
Cards QoQ increase was due to seasonality, with performance remaining 
favorable YoY and compared to pre-pandemic

##### Canadian Mortgages Renewal Profile


NoneImpacts of payment increases at renewal expected to be manageable

*
Using an illustrative 6% rate at time of renewal, and no borrower income growth since origination, mortgage payment increases are forecasted to 
be 
less than 5.1% 
of clients' income
*
Low LTV of renewal mortgages ranging from 41% to 60% over the next 5 years
*
Proactive outreach included a number of initiatives throughout the year to help our clients through the rising interest rate environment

##### Provision for Credit Losses (PCL) 


NoneTotal PCLs trended lower in Q4/23 driven by lower performing provision


NoneProvision for Credit Losses Ratio


NoneProvision for Credit Losses up YoY and down QoQ

*
Impaired provisions remained flat in Q4/23, largely due to higher 
impairments in the U.S. commercial and Canadian retail portfolios, 
offset by lower impairments in the Canadian commercial portfolio 
and CIBC FirstCaribbean
*
Performing provision in Q4/23 largely driven by U.S. commercial 
portfolio reflective of an allowance increase for the office sector,

Canada, securities, cash collateral on securities borrowed, securities purchased under resale agreements, loans net of allowances for credit losses, and certain sublease-related assets.
2.
The yield for loans and acceptances is calculated as interest income on loans as a percentage of average loans and acceptances, net of allowance for credit losses. The yield on securities is calculated as 
interest income on securities as a percentage of average securities. Total yield on average interest-earning assets is calculated as interest income on assets as a percentage of average interest-earning 
assets. These metrics do not have a standardized meaning and may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other financial institutions. 
3.
Other includes balances related to cash and deposits with banks, reverse repos, and other.

& Commercial-Notice/Demand deposits is calculated as interest expense on Corporate & Commercial-Notice/Demand deposits as a percentage of average Corporate & Commercial-Notice/Demand deposits. 
The yield for Term-Client deposits is calculated as interest expense on Term-Client deposits as a percentage of average Term-Client deposits. Term-Client deposits are term deposits less wholesale funding. 
Total cost on average interest-earning assets is calculated as interest expense on liabilities as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. These metrics do not have a standardized meaning and may 
not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other financial institutions.

4.
Charts reflect the allocation of foreign-exchange other than trading income (loss) between market-driven and transactional revenues.
5.
Adjusted results are non-GAAP measures. See slide 67 for further details. Reported non-interest income has been adjusted to remove the $34MM pre-tax impact of the commodity tax charge related to the 
retroactive impact of the 2023 Canadian Federal budget. This has impacted total Transactional Fees and the Cards balance within the Transactional Fees by $34MM.

show ex-refinancing as refinancing mortgages may have blended client rates without directly offsetting changes in our measurement for cost of funds.

##### Non-GAAP Measures


NoneFourth quarter and fiscal 2023

We use a number of financial measures to assess the performance of our business lines. Some measures are calculated in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS or GAAP), while other measures do not have a standardized meaning under GAAP, and accordingly, these measures may
not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Investors may find these non-GAAP measures, which include non-GAAP financial measures
and non-GAAP ratios as defined in National Instrument 52-112 "Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures Disclosure", useful in understanding how
management views underlying business performance.
Management assesses results on a reported and adjusted basis and considers both as useful measures of performance. Adjusted measures, which include
adjusted total revenue, adjusted provision for credit losses, adjusted non-interest expenses, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted income taxes,
adjusted net income and adjusted pre-provision, pre-tax earnings, in addition to the adjusted measures on slide 68 and 69, remove items of note from reported
results to calculate our adjusted results. Items of note include the amortization of intangible assets, and certain items of significance that arise from time to time
which management believes are not reflective of underlying business performance. Adjusted measures represent non-GAAP measures. We believe that
adjusted measures provide the reader with a better understanding of how management assesses underlying business performance and facilitates a more
informed analysis of trends. While we believe that adjusted measures may facilitate comparisons between our results and those of some of our Canadian peer
banks, which make similar adjustments in their public disclosure, it should be noted that there is no standardized meaning for adjusted measures under GAAP.
We also adjust our results to gross up tax-exempt revenue on certain securities to a TEB, being the amount of fully taxable revenue, which, were it to have
incurred tax at the statutory income tax rate, would yield the same after-tax revenue. See the "Strategic business units overview" and Note 30 to our
consolidated financial statements included in our 2023 Annual Report for further details, available on SEDAR+ at
 www.sedarplus.ca
.
Certain additional disclosures for these specified financial measures have been incorporated by reference and can be found in the "Non-GAAP measures"
section on pages 14 to 20 of our 2023 Annual Report, available on SEDAR+ at
 www.sedarplus.ca
, including the quantitative reconciliations therein of reported
GAAP measures to: adjusted total revenue, adjusted provision for credit losses, adjusted non-interest expenses, adjusted income before income taxes, adjusted
income taxes, and adjusted net income on pages 15 to 19; pre-provision, pre-tax earnings and adjusted pre-provision, pre-tax earnings on page 20.
