Pretax, pre-provision income (PTPI) is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by adjusting pretax income to add back provision for credit losses. Management believes that PTPI 
is a useful financial measure because it enables an assessment of the Corporation's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. (See Exhibit A: Non-
GAAP Reconciliations - Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 33.)
Tangible equity ratios and tangible book value per share of common stock are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides 
additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about 
the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock. (See Exhibit A: Non-GAAP Reconciliations - Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures on page 33.)
Current-period information is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the presentation.

 Regulatory capital ratios at June
30, 2023 are preliminary. We report regulatory capital ratios under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. Capital adequacy is evaluated 
against the lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Corporation's binding ratio was the Common 
equity tier 1 ratio under the Standardized approach for all periods presented. 
 Tangible equity ratio equals period-end tangible shareholders' equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible common equity ratio equals period-end tangible common 
shareholders' equity divided by period-end tangible assets. Tangible shareholders' equity and tangible assets are non-GAAP financial measures. We believe the use of ratios that 
utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. (See Exhibit A: Non-GAAP Reconciliations - 
Reconciliation to GAAP Financial Measures on page 33.)

 For this presentation, sales and trading revenue excludes net debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses) which include net DVA on derivatives, as well as amortization of own 
credit portion of purchase discount and realized DVA on structured liabilities. Sales and trading revenue excluding net DVA gains (losses) represents a non-GAAP financial measure. 
We believe the use of this non-GAAP financial measure provides additional useful information to assess the underlying performance of these businesses and to allow better 
comparison of period-to-period operating performance.
 Net DVA gains (losses) were $(88) million and $227 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, and $(102) million, $14 million, $(193) million, $(14) million and $158

 Consumer loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is 
expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. Prior to January 1, 2023, certain troubled debt restructurings were classified as 
nonperforming at the time of restructuring and were only returned to performing status after considering the borrower's sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, 
generally six months.
 Our policy is not to classify consumer credit card and non-bankruptcy related consumer loans not secured by real estate as nonperforming; therefore, the charge-offs on these 
loans have no impact on nonperforming activity and, accordingly, are excluded from this table.
 Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming.
 Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest 
is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. Prior to January 1, 2023, troubled debt restructurings were generally classified as 
performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance.
Current-period information is preliminary and based on company data available at the time of the presentation.

#### Exhibit A: Non-GAAP Reconciliations


#### Bank of America Corporation and Subsidiaries


### Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures

(Dollars in millions, except per share information)
The Corporation evaluates its business based on the following ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents shareholders' equity or 
common shareholders' equity reduced by goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities ("adjusted" shareholders' equity or 
common shareholders' equity). Return on average tangible common shareholders' equity measures the Corporation's net income applicable to common shareholders as a percentage 
of adjusted average common shareholders' equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by total tangible assets (total 
assets less goodwill and intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights), net of related deferred tax liabilities). Return on average tangible shareholders' equity measures the 
Corporation's net income as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders' equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders' equity divided by total 
tangible assets. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders' equity divided by ending common shares outstanding. These measures are 
used to evaluate the Corporation's use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models all use return on average tangible shareholders' equity as key measures 
to support our overall growth goals.
See the tables below for reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most closely related financial measures defined by GAAP for the six months ended June 30, 2023 
and 2022, and the three months ended June 30, 2023, March
31, 2023, December
31, 2022, September
30, 2022 and June
30, 2022. The Corporation believes the use of these non-
GAAP financial measures provides additional clarity in understanding its results of operations and trends. Other companies may define or calculate supplemental financial data 
differently.
