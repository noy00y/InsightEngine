#### TORONTO
TORONTO
, August 24, 2023 - TD Bank Group ("TD" or the "Bank") today announced its financial results for the third quarter ended July 31, 2023. Reported
earnings were $3.0 billion, down 8% compared with the third quarter last year, and adjusted earnings were $3.7 billion, down 2%.
"TD delivered strong revenue growth in the quarter and demonstrated the value of its diversified business mix in a challenging economic environment," said Bharat
Masrani, Group President and Chief Executive Officer, TD Bank Group. "Investments across our business further strengthened the Bank's ability to deliver
legendary experiences to more than 27 million customers."
##### Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking delivered strong results on continued loan and deposit growth
Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking delivered strong results on continued loan and deposit growth
Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking net income was $1,655 million, a decline of 1% compared to the third quarter last year. The decrease primarily
reflects higher provisions for credit losses (PCL), partially offset by revenue growth. Revenue was $4,570 million, an increase of 7%, reflecting volume growth and
higher margins. The segment delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage.
Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking maintained its position as a leading core deposit franchise, driven in part by strong account openings, including a
record quarter for New to Canada account openings. Strong credit card customer acquisition and continued loan growth in personal and business banking also
contributed to the segment's momentum. This quarter, TD further enhanced its collaboration with global brands including its sponsorship of the Toronto Blue Jays.
The Toronto Blue Jays added the TD shield to their iconic jersey and the Bank is developing exclusive in-game benefits for TD credit cardholders. In addition, TD's
Canadian mobile banking app was ranked "Highest in Customer Satisfaction" by J.D. Power in recognition of overall customer satisfaction for navigation, speed,
visual appeal, and content.

##### The U.S. Retail Bank delivered strong loan growth and resilient personal and business deposits
The U.S. Retail Bank delivered strong loan growth and resilient personal and business deposits
U.S. Retail reported net income of $1,314 million, a decrease of 9% (12% in U.S. dollars) compared with the third quarter last year. On an adjusted basis, net
income was $1,377 million, a decline of 6% (9% in U.S. dollars). Reported net income included acquisition and integration-related charges for the terminated First
Horizon Corporation ("First Horizon") transaction of $84 million or US$63 million ($63 million or US$48 million after-tax). TD Bank's investment in The Charles
Schwab Corporation ("Schwab") contributed $191 million in earnings, a decrease of 34% (37% in U.S. dollars) compared with the third quarter last year.
The U.S. Retail Bank, which excludes the Bank's investment in Schwab, reported net income of $1,123 million (US$842 million), a decrease of 3% (a decrease of
6% in U.S. dollars) from the third quarter last year, primarily reflecting higher non-interest expenses and higher PCL, partially offset by higher revenue. On an
adjusted basis, net income was $1,186 million (US$890 million), an increase of 1% (a decrease of 3% in U.S. dollars) from the third quarter last year, due to higher
revenue which was partially offset by higher expenses, and higher PCL as credit conditions continue to normalize.
The U.S. Retail Bank delivered another strong quarter, with personal loan growth of 11%, and business loan growth of 9%, reflecting new customer acquisition and
deepening relationships in core franchise businesses. Total personal and business deposit balances remained resilient in a challenging environment, further
strengthened by strong account acquisition in chequing and term deposits.
TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank(r) (TD AMCB) now serves over 10 million customers, including those being served by three new stores in low- and
moderate-income areas in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tampa, Florida, reflective of TD's commitment to reinvesting in communities. This quarter TD AMCB

Satisfaction among Non-Captive Lenders with Prime Credit" for the fourth consecutive year in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Dealer Financing Satisfaction Study.

##### Wealth Management and Insurance delivered strong operating momentum
Wealth Management and Insurance delivered strong operating momentum
Wealth Management and Insurance net income was $504 million, a decrease of 12% compared with the third quarter last year, reflecting the impact of more
severe weather-related events and lower transaction revenue in Wealth Management. Revenue increased 1% in the quarter, demonstrating the strength of the
segment's diversified business model, as higher insurance revenue and net interest income helped offset the impact of trading normalization.
This quarter, the Wealth Management business continued to gain market share, with TD Financial Planning expanding the fastest among the Big 5 Banks,
and
TD Asset Management extending its position as the leading Canadian Institutional asset manager.
TD Direct Investing maintained its #1 position across key
categories, including Total Accounts, Revenue, Trades, and Assets Under Administration, with record growth in share of gross new accounts.

##### Strong performance and growth across Wholesale Banking including TD Cowen
Strong performance and growth across Wholesale Banking including TD Cowen
Wholesale Banking reported net income for the quarter was $272 million, relatively flat compared to the third quarter last year. This reflects record revenue and
higher non-interest expenses, which include acquisition and integration costs, and reflects the first full quarter of revenues from TD Cowen. On an adjusted basis,
net income was $377 million, an increase of $106 million, or 39%. Revenue increased 46%, reflecting the benefits of the Cowen Inc. acquisition as well as growth
in Global Markets and Corporate and Investment Banking.
The integration of the Cowen Inc. acquisition, which closed on March 1, 2023, remains on track and will accelerate Wholesale Banking's U.S. dollar growth
strategy. The combined organization delivers an expanded product and service offering, increased depth in key business lines, greater scale and high-quality
talent.

Caution Regarding Forward-Looking Statements
From time to time, the Bank (as defined in this document) makes written and/or oral forward-looking statements, including in this document, in other filings with Canadian regulators or the United States
(U.S.) Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in other communications. In addition, representatives of the Bank may make forward-looking statements orally to analysts, investors, the media
and others. All such statements are made pursuant to the "safe harbour" provisions of, and are intended to be forward-looking statements under, applicable Canadian and U.S. securities legislation,
including the 
U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995
. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements made in this document, the Management's Discussion and
Analysis ("2022 MD&A") in the Bank's 2022 Annual Report under the heading "Economic Summary and Outlook", under the headings "Key Priorities for 2023" and "Operating Environment and Outlook" for

"estimate", "plan", "goal", "target", "may", and "could".
By their very nature, these forward-looking statements require the Bank to make assumptions and are subject to inherent risks and uncertainties, general and specific. Especially in light of the uncertainty
related to the physical, financial, economic, political, and regulatory environments, such risks and uncertainties - many of which are beyond the Bank's control and the effects of which can be difficult to
predict - may cause actual results to differ materially from the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements. Risk factors that could cause, individually or in the aggregate, such differences
include: strategic, credit, market (including equity, commodity, foreign exchange, interest rate, and credit spreads), operational (including technology, cyber security, and infrastructure), model, insurance,
liquidity, capital adequacy, legal, regulatory compliance and conduct, reputational, environmental and social, and other risks. Examples of such risk factors include general business and economic
conditions in the regions in which the Bank operates; geopolitical risk; inflation, rising rates and recession; the economic, financial, and other impacts of pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; the
ability of the Bank to execute on long-term strategies and shorter-term key strategic priorities, including the successful completion and integration of acquisitions and dispositions, business retention plans,
and strategic plans; technology and cyber security risk (including cyber-attacks, data security breaches or technology failures) on the Bank's information technology, internet, network access or other voice
or data communications systems or services; model risk; fraud activity; the failure of third parties to comply with their obligations to the Bank or its affiliates, including relating to the care and control of
information, and other risks arising from the Bank's use of third-party service providers; the impact of new and changes to, or application of, current laws and regulations, including without limitation tax
laws, capital guidelines and liquidity regulatory guidance; regulatory oversight and compliance risk; increased competition from incumbents and new entrants (including Fintechs and big technology
competitors); shifts in consumer attitudes and disruptive technology; exposure related to significant litigation and regulatory matters; ability of the Bank to attract, develop, and retain key talent; changes to
the Bank's credit ratings; changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices; increased funding costs and market volatility due to market illiquidity and competition for
funding; Interbank Offered Rate (IBOR) transition risk; critical accounting estimates and changes to accounting standards, policies, and methods used by the Bank; existing and potential international debt
crises; environmental and social risk (including climate change); and the occurrence of natural and unnatural catastrophic events and claims resulting from such events. The Bank cautions that the
preceding list is not exhaustive of all possible risk factors and other factors could also adversely affect the Bank's results. For more detailed information, please refer to the "Risk Factors and Management"
section of the 2022 MD&A, as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders and news releases (as applicable) related to any events or transactions discussed under the heading
"Significant Acquisitions", "Significant and Subsequent Events, and Pending Acquisitions", "Significant and Subsequent Events" or "Significant Events" in the relevant MD&A, which applicable releases may
be found on www.td.com
. All such factors, as well as other uncertainties and potential events, and the inherent uncertainty of forward-looking statements, should be considered carefully when making
decisions with respect to the Bank. The Bank cautions readers not to place undue reliance on the Bank's forward-looking statements.
Material economic assumptions underlying the forward-looking statements contained in this document are set out in the 2022 MD&A under the heading "Economic Summary and Outlook", under the
headings "Key Priorities for 2023" and "Operating Environment and Outlook" for the Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking
segments, and under the heading "2022 Accomplishments and Focus for 2023" for the Corporate segment, each as may be updated in subsequently filed quarterly reports to shareholders.

The Toronto-Dominion Bank ("TD" or the "Bank") prepares its Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS, the current GAAP, and refers to results prepared in
accordance with IFRS as the "reported" results. The Bank also utilizes non-GAAP financial measures such as "adjusted" results and non-GAAP ratios to assess each of its businesses
and to measure overall Bank performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts reported results for "items of note". Refer to the "How We Performed" section of this document
for further explanation, a list of the items of note, and a reconciliation of adjusted to reported results. Non-GAAP financial measures and ratios used in this document are not defined terms
under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers.
These measures have been included in this document in accordance with the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada's (OSFI's) Capital Adequacy Requirements,
Leverage Requirements, and Total Loss Absorbing Capacity (TLAC) guidelines. Refer to the "Capital Position" section in the third quarter of 2023 MD&A for further details.

### SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
a) 
##### Acquisition of Cowen Inc.
Acquisition of Cowen Inc.
On March 1, 2023, the Bank completed the acquisition of Cowen Inc. ("Cowen"). The acquisition advances the Wholesale Banking segment's long-term growth
strategy in the U.S. and adds complementary products and services to the Bank's existing businesses. The results of the acquired business have been
consolidated by the Bank from the closing date and primarily reported in the Wholesale Banking segment. Consideration included $1,500 million
(US$1,100 million) in cash for 100% of Cowen's common shares outstanding, $253 million (US$186 million) for the settlement of Cowen's Series A Preferred
Stock, and $205 million (US$151 million) related to the replacement of share-based payment awards.
The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under the purchase method. The purchase price allocation can be adjusted during the
measurement period, which shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances. The
acquisition contributed $10,800 million (US$7,933 million) of assets and $9,884 million (US$7,261 million) of liabilities. The excess of accounting consideration
over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired is allocated to other intangible assets of $298 million (US$219 million) net of taxes, and goodwill of

#####  Termination of the Merger Agreement with First Horizon Corporation
 Termination of the Merger Agreement with First Horizon Corporation
On May 4, 2023, the Bank and First Horizon Corporation ("First Horizon") announced their mutual decision to terminate the previously announced merger
agreement for the Bank to acquire First Horizon. Under the terms of the termination agreement, the Bank made a $306 million (US$225 million) cash payment to
First Horizon on May 5, 2023. The termination payment is recognized in non-interest expenses in the current quarter and is reported in the Corporate segment.
In connection with the transaction, the Bank had invested US$494 million in non-voting First Horizon preferred stock. During the prior quarter, the Bank
recognized a valuation adjustment loss of $199 million (US$147 million) on this investment, recorded in other comprehensive income. On June 26, 2023, in
accordance with the terms of the preferred share purchase agreement, the preferred stock converted into approximately 19.7 million common shares of First
Horizon, resulting in the Bank recognizing a loss of $166 million (US$126 million) in other comprehensive income based on First Horizon's common share price at
the time of conversion.
The Bank had also implemented a strategy to mitigate the impact of interest rate volatility to capital on closing of the acquisition. The Bank determined that the
fair value of First Horizon's fixed rate financial assets and liabilities and certain intangible assets would have been sensitive to interest rate changes. The fair value
of net assets would have determined the amount of goodwill to be recognized on closing of the acquisition. Increases in goodwill and intangibles would have
negatively impacted capital ratios because they are deducted from capital under OSFI Basel III rules. In order to mitigate this volatility to closing capital, the Bank
de-designated certain interest rate swaps hedging fixed income investments in fair value hedge accounting relationships.
As a result of the de-designation, mark-to-market gains (losses) on these swaps were recognized in earnings, without any corresponding offset from the
previously hedged investments. Such gains (losses) would have mitigated the capital impact from changes in the amount of goodwill recognized on closing of the
acquisition. The de-designation also triggered the amortization of the investments' basis adjustment to net interest income over the remaining expected life of the
investments.
Prior to the termination of the merger agreement on May 4, 2023, for the three months and nine months ended July 31, 2023, the Bank reported ($125) million
and ($1,386) million, respectively, in non-interest income related to the mark-to-market on the swaps, and $11 million and $262 million, respectively, in net interest
income related to the basis adjustment amortization. In addition, for the three months and nine months ended July 31, 2023, the Bank reported $23 million and
Following the announcement to terminate the merger agreement, the Bank discontinued this strategy and reinstated hedge accounting on the portfolio of fixed
income investments using new swaps entered into at higher market rates. Income recognized from this strategy will reverse over time causing a decrease to net
interest income. During the period, the decrease to net interest income was $63 million recorded in the Corporate segment.
The Bank had also implemented a strategy to mitigate FX risk on the expected USD cash consideration. Following the announcement to terminate the merger
agreement, the Bank discontinued this strategy. Given the appreciation of the U.S. dollar during the life of the strategy, the Bank was in a net gain position on the
date of hedge termination and cumulative net gains were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.
c)
#####  Implementation of the Canada Recovery Dividend and Change in Corporate Tax Rate
 Implementation of the Canada Recovery Dividend and Change in Corporate Tax Rate
On December 15, 2022, Bill C-32, 
Fall Economic Statement Implementation Act
, 
2022
, received Royal Assent. This bill enacted the Canada Recovery Dividend
(CRD) and increased the Canadian federal tax rate for bank and life insurer groups by 1.5%.
The implementation of the CRD resulted in a provision for income taxes of $553 million and a charge to other comprehensive income of $239 million,
recognized in the first quarter of 2023.
The increase in the Canadian federal tax rate of 1.5%, prorated for the first taxation year that ends after April 7, 2022, resulted in a provision for income taxes of
certain Canadian deferred tax assets and liabilities for the increase in tax rate, which resulted in an increase in net deferred tax assets of $50 million, which is
recorded in provision for income taxes.
d)
#####  Stanford Litigation Settlement
 Stanford Litigation Settlement
In the US 
Rotstain v. Trustmark National Bank, et al. 
action, on February 24, 2023, the Bank reached a settlement in principle (the "settlement" or "agreement")
relating to litigation involving the Stanford Financial Group (the "Stanford litigation"), pursuant to which the Bank will pay US$1.205 billion to the court-appointed
receiver for the Stanford Receivership Estate. Under the terms of the agreement, TD has settled with the receiver, the Official Stanford Investors Committee, and
other plaintiffs in the litigation and these parties have agreed to release and dismiss all current or future claims arising from or related to the Stanford matter. As a
result of this agreement, the Bank recorded a provision of approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax ($1.2 billion after-tax) in the first quarter of 2023. The Bank recognized
a foreign exchange loss of $39 million ($28 million after-tax) in the second quarter of 2023, reflecting the impact of the difference between the foreign exchange
rate used for recording the provision (effective January 31, 2023) and the foreign exchange rate at the time the settlement was reached.

### HOW WE PERFORMED
HOW WE PERFORMED
#### HOW THE BANK REPORTS
HOW THE BANK REPORTS
The Bank prepares its Interim Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS and refers to results prepared in accordance with IFRS as "reported"
results.
##### Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
Non-GAAP and Other Financial Measures
In addition to reported results, the Bank also presents certain financial measures, including non-GAAP financial measures that are historical, non-GAAP ratios,
supplementary financial measures and capital management measures, to assess its results. Non-GAAP financial measures, such as "adjusted" results, are utilized
to assess the Bank's businesses and to measure the Bank's overall performance. To arrive at adjusted results, the Bank adjusts for "items of note" from reported
results. Items of note are items which management does not believe are indicative of underlying business performance and are disclosed in Table 3. Non-GAAP
ratios include a non-GAAP financial measure as one or more of its components. Examples of non-GAAP ratios include adjusted basic and diluted earnings per
share (EPS), adjusted dividend payout ratio, adjusted efficiency ratio, and adjusted effective income tax rate. The Bank believes that non-GAAP financial
measures and non-GAAP ratios provide the reader with a better understanding of how management views the Bank's performance. Non-GAAP financial measures
and non-GAAP ratios used in this document are not defined terms under IFRS and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar terms used by other issuers.
Supplementary financial measures depict the Bank's financial performance and position, and capital management measures depict the Bank's capital position, and
both are explained in this document where they first appear.
##### U.S. Strategic Cards
U.S. Strategic Cards
The Bank's U.S. strategic cards portfolio is comprised of agreements with certain U.S. retailers pursuant to which TD is the U.S. issuer of private label and co
branded consumer credit cards to their U.S. customers. Under the terms of the individual agreements, the Bank and the retailers share in the profits generated by
the relevant portfolios after credit losses. Under IFRS, TD is required to present the gross amount of revenue and provisions for credit losses (PCL) related to
these portfolios in the Bank's Interim Consolidated Statement of Income. At the segment level, the retailer program partners' share of revenues and credit losses is
presented in the Corporate segment, with an offsetting amount (representing the partners' net share) recorded in Non-interest expenses, resulting in no impact to
Corporate's reported Net income (loss). The Net income (loss) included in the U.S. Retail segment includes only the portion of revenue and credit losses
attributable to TD under the agreements.
##### Investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation and IDA Agreement
Investment in The Charles Schwab Corporation and IDA Agreement
On October 6, 2020, the Bank acquired an approximately 13.5% stake in The Charles Schwab Corporation ("Schwab") following the completion of Schwab's
acquisition of TD Ameritrade Holding Corporation ("TD Ameritrade") of which the Bank was a major shareholder (the "Schwab transaction"). On August 1, 2022,
the Bank sold 28.4 million non-voting common shares of Schwab, which reduced the Bank's ownership interest in Schwab to approximately 12.0%. The Bank
accounts for its investment in Schwab using the equity method. The U.S. Retail segment reflects the Bank's share of net income from its investment in Schwab.
The Corporate segment net income (loss) includes amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and integration charges related to the
Schwab transaction. The Bank's share of Schwab's earnings available to common shareholders is reported with a one-month lag. For further details, refer to
Note 7 of the Bank's third quarter 2023 Interim Consolidated Financial Statements.
On November 25, 2019, the Bank and Schwab signed an insured deposit account agreement ("2019 Schwab IDA Agreement"), with an initial expiration date of
July 1, 2031. Pursuant to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the Bank made sweep deposit accounts available to clients of Schwab. Starting July 1, 2021, Schwab
had the option to reduce the deposits by up to US$10 billion per year (subject to certain limitations and adjustments), with a floor of US$50 billion. In addition,
Schwab requested some further operational flexibility to allow for the sweep deposit balances to fluctuate over time, under certain conditions and subject to certain
limitations. Refer to the "Related Party Transactions" section in the 2022 MD&A for further details.
On May 4, 2023, the Bank and Schwab entered into an amended insured deposit account agreement (the "2023 Schwab IDA Agreement"), which replaced the
2019 Schwab IDA Agreement. In comparison to the 2019 Schwab IDA Agreement, the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement extends the initial expiration date by three
years to July 1, 2034 and provides for lower deposit balances in its first six years, followed by higher balances in the later years. Specifically, until
September 2025, the aggregate amount of fixed rate obligations will serve as the floor. Thereafter, the floor will be set at US$60 billion. In addition, Schwab has
the option to buy down up to US$5 billion of fixed rate obligations by paying the Bank certain fees in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, subject to
certain limits.
During the third quarter of 2023, Schwab exercised its option to buy down $3.3 billion (US$2.4 billion) of fixed rate obligations and paid $151 million
(US$112 million) in termination fees to the Bank in accordance with the 2023 Schwab IDA Agreement, which is intended to compensate the Bank for losses
incurred this quarter from discontinuing certain hedging relationships, and lost revenues. The net impact is recorded in net interest income.

The consolidated Bank ROE is calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity. The
consolidated Bank adjusted ROE is calculated as adjusted net income available to common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity. Adjusted
ROE is a non-GAAP financial ratio and can be utilized in assessing the Bank's use of equity.
ROE for the business segments is calculated as the segment net income attributable to common shareholders as a percentage of average allocated capital. The
Bank's methodology for allocating capital to its business segments is largely aligned with the common equity capital requirements under Basel III. Capital allocated
to the business segments was increased to 11% Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital effective the first quarter of 2023, compared with 10.5% in fiscal 2022.

Tangible common equity (TCE) is calculated as common shareholders' equity less goodwill, imputed goodwill and intangibles on the investments in Schwab and
other acquired intangible assets, net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE is calculated as reported net income available to common shareholders after
adjusting for the after-tax amortization of acquired intangibles, which are treated as an item of note, as a percentage of average TCE. Adjusted ROTCE is
calculated using reported net income available to common shareholders, adjusted for all items of note, as a percentage of average TCE. TCE, ROTCE, and
adjusted ROTCE can be utilized in assessing the Bank's use of equity. TCE is a non-GAAP financial measure, and ROTCE and adjusted ROTCE are non-GAAP

### HOW OUR BUSINESSES PERFORMED
HOW OUR BUSINESSES PERFORMED
For management reporting purposes, the Bank's business operations and activities are organized around the following four key business segments: Canadian
Personal and Commercial Banking, U.S. Retail, Wealth Management and Insurance, and Wholesale Banking. The Bank's other activities are grouped into the
Corporate segment.
Results of each business segment reflect revenue, expenses, assets, and liabilities generated by the businesses in that segment. Where applicable, the Bank
measures and evaluates the performance of each segment based on adjusted results and ROE, and for those segments, the Bank indicates that the measure is
adjusted. For further details, refer to the "How We Performed" section of this document, the "Business Focus" section in the Bank's 2022 MD&A, and Note 29 of
the Bank's Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended October 31, 2022.
PCL related to performing (Stage 1 and Stage 2) and impaired (Stage 3) financial assets, loan commitments, and financial guarantees is recorded within the
respective segment.
Net interest income within Wholesale Banking is calculated on a taxable equivalent basis (TEB), which means that the value of non-taxable or tax-exempt
income, including certain dividends, is adjusted to its equivalent pre-tax value. Using TEB allows the Bank to measure income from all securities and loans
consistently and makes for a more meaningful comparison of net interest income with similar institutions. The TEB increase to net interest income and provision for
income taxes reflected in Wholesale Banking results is reversed in the Corporate segment. The TEB adjustment for the quarter was $40 million, compared with
Share of net income from investment in Schwab is reported in the U.S. Retail segment. Amounts for amortization of acquired intangibles and the acquisition and
integration charges related to the Schwab transaction are recorded in the Corporate segment.

recorded in the Corporate segment.
Capital allocated to the business segment was increased to 11% CET1 Capital effective the first quarter of 2023, compared with 10.5% in the prior year.
Net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interest-earning assets. For the U.S. Retail segment, this calculation excludes the impact related to sweep
deposits arrangements and intercompany deposits and cash collateral. The value of tax-exempt interest income is adjusted to its equivalent before-tax value. For investment securities,
the adjustment to fair value is included in the calculation of average interest-earning assets. Management believes this calculation better reflects segment performance. Net interest
income and average interest-earning assets used in the calculation are non-GAAP financial measures.
For additional information about this metric, refer to the Glossary in the Bank's third quarter 2023 MD&A.
